Currently unsafe. Do not use outside of test environment.

## Dependencies

This system requires Python 3.4+. [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py), [atomicswap](https://github.com/ValexCrypto/atomicswap) is a dependency for both the miner and trader APIs, and [ethatomicswap](https://github.com/ValexCrypto/ethatomicswap) are dependencies for the trader API.

## Setup

These instructions assume you are already connected to a running Ethereum network or simulator, with a deployed instance of the Valex Exchange contract.
